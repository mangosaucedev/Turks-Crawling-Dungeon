		<Page>Emotional Regulation Worksheet
		
		Emotion: Grief
		Intensity: 10
		
		What event(s) triggered the emotion?
		Woke up from a dream about Ren. We were holding hands, wandering the crowded halls of the convention center and getting ourselves lost. Every rounded corner took us to a totally new world to explore. I couldn't stop smiling and laughing to myself. I felt like a kid again! I couldn't believe I was sharing this adventure with my best friend in the whole world! Then I woke up and the joy receded and the emptiness surged to take its place. I wanted to cry but no tears came.</Page>

		<Page>What happened that made you vulnerable to these events?
		I still have pictures of them on my phone (I looked through them last night). I sleep too much. I eat too little. I take a fistful of hypnotics to knock myself out at night and speed in the morning to get out of bed.
		
		What are your interpretations of the situation?
		I'm dying, I'm wasting away. Without Ren, I don't have a reason to get out of bed that isn't pills. They left me to die here. It's agony.</Page>

		<Page>What did you do in this situation?
		Stayed in bed all afternoon. Texted my sister. Tried to delete the pictures but I couldn't bring myself to let go of those memories. They're all I have of Ren now that they've gone.</Page>
